  		<p>I am a problem solver whose passion is delivering solutions. Trained in Mechanical Engineering, I am a former options trader and self-taught web developer.</p>
  		<p>Leaving a prior life in New York, I find myself in Wellington, NZ with my wife and two kids in pursuit of new challenges, nature and the perfect cup of coffee.</p>
  		<h3 class="subsection">What I do</h3>
  		<p>I make well-structured web applications using modern JavaScript tools. Architecting solutions from wireframes makes me happy.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Angular, React, Polymer Web Components</li>
        <li>node, npm, gulp</li>
        <li>Data Visualization with D3.js</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Things I dabble in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>C#</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Things I can't wait to get my hands on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Objective-C</li>
        <li>React Native</li>
      </ul>
  		<h3 class="subsection">Philosophy</h3>
  		<p>I aim to ship highly functioning code that is well organized, structured and easy to follow. Which framework makes sense? Perhaps none. I automate to the max. Having peers critique my work is my favorite path to personal growth. Fresh challenges to master and shipping code gets me out of bed in the morning.</p>
